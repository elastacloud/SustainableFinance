# Trade Finance Sustainability Sample
The following example was developed during a workshop hosted by [Finextra](https://www.finextra.com "Finextra's Homepage") and [Responsible Risk](https://www.responsiblerisk.com/ "Responsible Risk Homepage")

The following sample was based on a workshop which we undertook with a small group of people and simple use case to try and understand what sustainability is. It is the start of a reporting platform aimed to breakdown and present back summary statistics and drilldown for companies in the energy and mining sectors looking for trade finance. 

It plots a history of ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) and gives an impact score.

The dashboard allows drill-down of the various ESG criteria to determine the average and aggregate risk scores based solely on sustainability.
